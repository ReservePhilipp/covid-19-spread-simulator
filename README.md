# Virus spread simulator ðŸ¦ 

Fork of midudev's excellent code.  For demo only. 

Wanted to add support for Hospitals, with better recovery And to show what happens when Hospitals are overwhelmed.


Obviously just test numbers, but the idea is that :

5% mortality, but
10% of infected need hospitalization and with finite places
"only" 30% mortality if they get to hospital, 90% if not.

There are some bugs!   Its been at least 15 years since last time i coded. :-)
